## Description
This application serves as my main portfolio. It was made with react and showcases my skills in all types of web development fields. I hope you enjoy the UI, color scheme, fonts, and  more.

Here's a sneak peak!

This serves not only as a passion project for me, but one that I hope otm carry with my and refine throughout my career.
It's a small sample of my hardwork and determination and I hope that it shows!

I wanted to make a nice README for this as well. I believe its very important to make these look nice and full. Below you'll find code snippets with further
explanations, as well as credits and licensing information!

Thanks so much for stopping by!

vite config is pretty standard but we added some server properties so it will open the server immediately when app is ran.

Here is the actual App code that is repsonsible for the single page layout and order.

Code responsible for main aboutme page, not much special going on here mostly just bootstrap styling with a simple download for my resume.

Here's the page to contact me, it gets a little more complicated here because we are using React useState to dynamically grab the user's input. We do
this simply to check that the fields are not null. Here's the initial set up.

Here we have a simple navigation section that uses handlePageChange(). Nothing too complex going on here.
